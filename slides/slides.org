** Icebreaker

* Why consider alternatives?
** Monocultures are fragile
** Git is distributed by design
** It's good to have backup options

* A brief (and probably wrong) history of version control :draft:
** In the beginning there was Unix

Shared access to files

#+attr_reveal: :frag fade
What if *two people*\\
edit the *same file*\\
at the *same time*...

** RCS: Revision Control System

Works through file locking

Per-file history

No concept of a "repository"

** CVS: Concurrent Version System

A front end to RCS



** Subversion


* Over to you

*5 minutes* in breakout rooms

- What do you use GitHub for?
  - If you /don't/ use it: what do you use instead?
- What features do you use?
- What would you miss most/least if it wasn't there?
